# Birkbeck R workshop

Welcome to our R workshop. In this GitHub repository, you can find all materials you will need for the two days. To get them onto your machine, just click on <span col="green"> *<> Code* </span> and then Download ZIP. Make sure to extract the files from zip - just opening them from there will lead to trouble later on.
